Held every four years, this prestigious football event amasses a [global viewership in the billions](https://www.statista.com/chart/28766/global-reach-and-tv-viewership-of-the-fifa-world-cup/) and [Singaporeans](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/www.ipsos.com/en-sg/more-half-adults-singapore-plan-watch-2022-fifa-world-cup) are not immune to the World Cup craze. However, the World Cup is more than fun and entertainment. This sporting event has offered job opportunities to Singaporeans, from [training match officials](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/www.straitstimes.com/sport/world-cup-meet-m-ganesan-the-man-from-singapore-who-is-a-brother-to-match-officials-in-qatar) to selling [bubble tea](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/www.straitstimes.com/videos/world-cup-the-singaporean-who-took-bubble-tea-to-qatar--dispatches-from-doha/6316614929112). 

 

Touted as the “beautiful game” that unites rather than divides, numerous criticisms of the World Cup over the years beg the question of whether the charm of the global sporting event really transcends socio-political and economic problems. The FIFA 2022 World Cup kicked off in the small gulf state of Qatar, amid a backdrop of [celebrations](https://www.goal.com/en-sg/lists/why-the-world-cup-is-the-ultimate-moment-of-celebration/blt61bfdee112428517#csa2d63f154033526e)[ ](https://www.goal.com/en-sg/lists/why-the-world-cup-is-the-ultimate-moment-of-celebration/blt61bfdee112428517#csa2d63f154033526e)and [controversies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/11/18/qatar-world-cup-migrant-workers/). 

 

Major sporting events like the [Olympics](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/economics-hosting-olympic-games) and the World Cup could generate [multibillion-dollar investments and “intangible legacy”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7obedVLB_k) for host countries. Other benefits include [new infrastructure](https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2022/11/17/do-host-countries-make-money-from-the-world-cup) projects, [improved international perception](https://pitjournal.unc.edu/article/assessing-long-term-economic-impacts-world-cup-mega-sport-event) of host countries and [celebrating unity](https://medium.com/@overtake/more-than-just-a-game-football-brings-people-together-e92802328132) in [a shared love](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/no-politics-iran-usa-fans-195829336.html?guccounter=1) for the game. 

 

However, speculations on [the actual economic gains in the long term](https://theconversation.com/hosting-the-fifa-world-cup-brings-benefits-but-not-as-many-as-politicians-claim-190923), [corruption](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/18/1137204271/qatar-world-cup-controversies) allegations of officials, ethics of “[sportswashing](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/theconversation.com/world-cup-2022-qatar-is-accused-of-sportswashing-but-do-the-fans-really-care-193485)”, the [social cost](https://youtu.be/C-0CebFpF_s) of construction and[ issues of human rights](https://www.unisg.ch/en/newsdetail/news/world-cup-in-qatar-more-than-a-game/) seem to mar any “goodwill” and “good-feeling” arising from the World Cup.

## **So, is the World Cup good for the world?**

[<a href="#top">Back to top</a>]	

| **YES, THE WORLD CUP BRINGS BENEFITS TO THE WORLD.**<br>     | **NO, THE WORLD CUP RAISES PROBLEMS FOR THE WORLD.**         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **The World Cup promises opportunities for economic gains.**<br><br>Host countries stand to [gain financial investment in sporting and public infrastructure](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-host-the-world-cup-by-andrew-zimbalist-2018-06) and [economic benefits](https://pitjournal.unc.edu/article/assessing-long-term-economic-impacts-world-cup-mega-sport-event) in the long term.<BR><BR>Some experts are optimistic that economic growth can be sustained by leveraging on the most-watched sporting event to showcase Qatar’s “[state-of-the-art transportation systems, world class tourism and culinary experiences… and generous hospitality](https://www.gulf-times.com/article/650224/opinion/hosting-the-fifa-world-cup-2022-impact-on-qatar-and-the-region)”.BR><BR>There are [increased digital marketing opportunities ](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/fifa-world-cup-effect-qatar-tech-stock-market-app-social-media-food-delivery-3086121)as more viewers are digitally engaged with the World Cup. [F&B operators and delivery platforms](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/fb-outlets-and-food-delivery-platforms-score-big-during-world-cup-2022) may also reap benefits given the social nature of watching the games.<br> | **The true cost of the World Cup cannot be ignored.**<br><br>Criticisms of t[he working conditions of labourers](https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2014/7/3/world-cup-workers-struggle-for-basic-rights) in preparation for the World Cup have [plagued the tournament over the years](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/25/fifa-world-cup-2018-workers-human-rights-abuses). <br><br>The huge expenses borne by host countries [may not be offset](https://www.managementstudyguide.com/effects-of-fifa-world-cup-on-economy.htm) by potential economic gains in tourism. Additionally, the [organising body for the World Cup may stand to gain more](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/why-hosting-the-world-cup-can-be-a-bad-idea-for-some-countries.html) financially than host countries. <br><br>Sporting infrastructure built specifically for the event may become [“white elephant” structures](https://youtu.be/AOHP0pH0yMA) after the World Cup ends.<br> |
| **It provides a stage for countries to improve international relations.** <br><br>Hosting the World Cup is an opportunity to [garner soft power](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/10/26/the-qatar-world-cup-footballing-for-soft-power/) and garner support from the international community. <br><br>The global sporting event allows nations to showcase a favourable image to global and domestic audiences: from highlighting “[change and progress](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09523367.2021.1988932)” within host nations to visiting nations such as the [Japanese](https://mothership.sg/2022/12/japan-croatia-fans-clean-stadium/) and [Moroccans](https://www.dailysabah.com/sports/football/morocco-captures-imagination-by-reciting-from-quran-before-shootout), displaying positive traits.<br> | **Existing socio-political issues may be exacerbated.** <br/><br/>The World Cup tournaments have a long [history of politics mixing with sports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyZ7ULF349M), casting a spotlight on global politics.<br/><br/> [Mixed public opinion surveys ](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/10/26/the-qatar-world-cup-footballing-for-soft-power/)and [critical media coverage](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/23/middleeast/why-arabs-are-furious-world-cup-mime-intl/index.html) could impact national reputations. <br/><br/>[Political expressions on the field](https://www.theweek.in/theweek/cover/2022/11/11/football-players-political-views-qatar-world-cup.html), sanctioned or not, and calls for [boycotts](https://www.euronews.com/2022/11/10/fifa-and-qatar-rattled-as-european-world-cup-boycott-gathers-pace), further highlight the [socio-political tensions](https://theconversation.com/fifas-mirage-of-unity-why-the-world-cup-is-a-vessel-for-political-protest-195432).<br/><br/> |
| **It serves as a shared experience.** <br/><br/>The [billions of viewers ](https://www.beinsports.com/en/fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022/news/bein-mena-viewership-exceeds-one-billion-for-/1996664)simultaneously tuning in to the World Cup provides a truly[ global shared experience](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/responses/when-globalism-outscores-nationalism) beyond borders.  <br/><br/>An opportunity for solidarity, differences, be it on the [domestic](https://medium.com/@overtake/more-than-just-a-game-football-brings-people-together-e92802328132) or [political](https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/world-cup-arab-fans-unite-after-surprise-wins-in-qatar) front, could be set aside as fans [unite under one flag](https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2022/11/7/world-cup-2022-thousands-of-argentina-fans-flock-to-qatar). | **Not everyone views the game as truly unifying.**  <br/><br/>Some critics have viewed that sporting events such as football are just games, with [no real importance](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14660970.2020.1797496) to our lives. <br/><br/>The competition also seems to further support a “[nationally divided world](https://www.unisg.ch/en/newsdetail/news/world-cup-in-qatar-more-than-a-game/)”, under the spectacle of entertainment and sporting rivalry.<br/><br/> Additionally, global sporting events are a hotbed for [conflicting expressions of nationhood](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/about.illinoisstate.edu/dist/e/34/files/2019/09/Alexander_Nelson_pdf.pdf) and [belonging](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09523367.2020.1844188). |
