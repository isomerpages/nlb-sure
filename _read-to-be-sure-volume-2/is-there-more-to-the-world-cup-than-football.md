Held every four years, this international football event gets a [global viewership in the billions](https://www.statista.com/chart/28766/global-reach-and-tv-viewership-of-the-fifa-world-cup/) and [Singaporeans](https://www.ipsos.com/en-sg/more-half-adults-singapore-plan-watch-2022-fifa-world-cup) also get caught up in the excitement of the World Cup. However, the World Cup is more than fun and entertainment. This sporting event has offered economic and job opportunities to many, including Singaporeans, from [training match officials](https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/world-cup-meet-m-ganesan-the-man-from-singapore-who-is-a-brother-to-match-officials-in-qatar) to selling [bubble tea](https://www.straitstimes.com/videos/world-cup-the-singaporean-who-took-bubble-tea-to-qatar--dispatches-from-doha/6316614929112). 

 

Although it is known as the “beautiful game”, it has also drawn its share of criticisms. The FIFA 2022 World Cup kicked off in the small gulf state of Qatar, amid a backdrop of [celebrations](https://www.goal.com/en-sg/lists/why-the-world-cup-is-the-ultimate-moment-of-celebration/blt61bfdee112428517#csa2d63f154033526e)[ ](https://www.goal.com/en-sg/lists/why-the-world-cup-is-the-ultimate-moment-of-celebration/blt61bfdee112428517#csa2d63f154033526e)and some [controversies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/11/18/qatar-world-cup-migrant-workers/). 

 

Major sporting events like the [Olympics](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/economics-hosting-olympic-games) and the World Cup could generate [multibillion-dollar investments and “intangible legacy”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7obedVLB_k) for host countries. These result in benefits for the host country such as [new infrastructure](https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2022/11/17/do-host-countries-make-money-from-the-world-cup) and [improved international perception](https://pitjournal.unc.edu/article/assessing-long-term-economic-impacts-world-cup-mega-sport-event) as it unites the world in [a shared love](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/no-politics-iran-usa-fans-195829336.html?guccounter=1) for sports. 

 

However, some also question the [benefits of hosting such major games](https://theconversation.com/hosting-the-fifa-world-cup-brings-benefits-but-not-as-many-as-politicians-claim-190923). This includes questions on the [infrastructure built](https://youtu.be/C-0CebFpF_s) and if it has longer term benefits, or the issue of "[sportswashing](https://theconversation.com/world-cup-2022-qatar-is-accused-of-sportswashing-but-do-the-fans-really-care-193485)"”.

## **Does the World Cup score a goal (or two) in your books?**

[<a href="#top">Back to top</a>]	

| **YES, THE WORLD CUP BRINGS BENEFITS TO THE WORLD.**         | **NO, THE WORLD CUP RAISES PROBLEMS FOR THE WORLD.**<br>     |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **The World Cup promises opportunities for economic gains.**<br>Host countries stand to [gain with investments in sporting and public infrastructure](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/why-host-the-world-cup-by-andrew-zimbalist-2018-06) and [economic benefits](https://pitjournal.unc.edu/article/assessing-long-term-economic-impacts-world-cup-mega-sport-event) in the long term. <br/><br/>Some experts are optimistic that economic growth can be sustained by showcasing [Qatar’s](https://www.gulf-times.com/article/650224/opinion/hosting-the-fifa-world-cup-2022-impact-on-qatar-and-the-region) “state-of-the-art transportation systems, world class tourism and culinary experiences… and generous hospitality”. <br/><br/>There are [increased digital marketing opportunities ](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/fifa-world-cup-effect-qatar-tech-stock-market-app-social-media-food-delivery-3086121) as more viewers are digitally engaged with the World Cup. [F&B operators and delivery platforms](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/fb-outlets-and-food-delivery-platforms-score-big-during-world-cup-2022) may also reap benefits given the social nature of watching the games.<br><br> | **The true cost of the World Cup cannot be ignored.**<br>Criticisms of t[he working conditions of those who ](https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/the-world-cup-and-human-rights-in-brazil)helped lay the physical infrastructure for the World Cup have been rife. <br><br/>The huge expenses incurred by host countries [may not be offset](https://www.managementstudyguide.com/effects-of-fifa-world-cup-on-economy.htm) by potential economic gains, such as through tourism. <br/>Sporting infrastructure built specifically for the event may become [“white elephant” structures](https://youtu.be/AOHP0pH0yMA) after the World Cup ends. <br><br/> |
| **It provides a stage for countries to improve international relations.** <br><br>Hosting the World Cup is an opportunity to project a more positive image, and [gain soft power](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/10/26/the-qatar-world-cup-footballing-for-soft-power/) and support from the international community. For instance, host nations could take this chance to highlight “[change and progress](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09523367.2021.1988932)” to [visiting nations](https://mothership.sg/2022/12/japan-croatia-fans-clean-stadium/) on an international stage.<br> | **Existing socio-political issues may be exacerbated.** <br/><br/>The World Cup tournaments over the years have had a [history of politics mixing with sports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyZ7ULF349M). <br><br/>[Political expressions on the field](https://www.theweek.in/theweek/cover/2022/11/11/football-players-political-views-qatar-world-cup.html), sanctioned or not, and calls for [boycotts](https://www.euronews.com/2022/11/10/fifa-and-qatar-rattled-as-european-world-cup-boycott-gathers-pace), highlight the [socio-political tensions](https://theconversation.com/fifas-mirage-of-unity-why-the-world-cup-is-a-vessel-for-political-protest-195432).<br/><br/>[Mixed public opinion surveys ](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/10/26/the-qatar-world-cup-footballing-for-soft-power/)and [critical media coverage](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/23/middleeast/why-arabs-are-furious-world-cup-mime-intl/index.html) could impact national reputations.<br/><br/> |
| **It serves as a shared experience.** <br/><br/>The [billions of viewers ](https://www.beinsports.com/en/fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022/news/bein-mena-viewership-exceeds-one-billion-for-/1996664)simultaneously tuning in to the World Cup makes for a truly [global shared experience](https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/responses/when-globalism-outscores-nationalism) beyond borders. <br/><br/>An opportunity for solidarity, differences, be it on the [domestic](https://medium.com/@overtake/more-than-just-a-game-football-brings-people-together-e92802328132) or [political](https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/world-cup-arab-fans-unite-after-surprise-wins-in-qatar) front, could be set aside as fans [unite under one flag](https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2022/11/7/world-cup-2022-thousands-of-argentina-fans-flock-to-qatar).<br><br>Rooting for the “lesser known teams” in any sporting event has the power to [rally spectators from various countries or cultures](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/moroccos-surprise-world-cup-run-rallied-legion-arab-fans-rcna60907), especially if they embody identities that are often [under-represented](https://www.vox.com/2015/3/20/8260445/underdogs-psychology).<br><br> | **Not everyone views the game as truly unifying.**  <br/><br/>Some critics say that sporting events such as football are just games, with [no real importance](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14660970.2020.1797496) to our lives.<br/><br/>The competition also seems to further support a “[nationally divided world](https://www.unisg.ch/en/newsdetail/news/world-cup-in-qatar-more-than-a-game/)”, under the spectacle of entertainment and sporting rivalry.<br/><br/>Additionally, global sporting events are a hotbed for [conflicting expressions of nationhood](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/about.illinoisstate.edu/dist/e/34/files/2019/09/Alexander_Nelson_pdf.pdf) and [belonging](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09523367.2020.1844188). |
