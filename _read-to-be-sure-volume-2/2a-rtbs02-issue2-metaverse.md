The term [metaverse](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-the-metaverse/) can broadly include virtual reality, which is characterised by persistent virtual worlds, as well as augmented reality that combines aspects of the digital and physical worlds. The metaverse enables people to have real time interactions and experiences across distance. 

 

To understand the concepts of a metaverse, think of it as the next generation of the Internet that may provide a more immersive virtual experience. Many companies that have embraced the metaverse envisage that it would bring about some sort of new digital economy, where users can create, buy, and sell goods. 

 

The promise of the metaverse is that it could provide a greater convergence of our digital and physical lives in wealth, socialisation, productivity, shopping, and entertainment. However, as the experience of virtual worlds and digital commerce in the metaverse grow in scope and scale, virtual crimes such as assault and theft may become a serious issue.

## **So, will the metaverse be a virtual paradise?**

The lack of understanding of how to navigate the immersive spaces safely may leave minors susceptible to [exploitation](https://blog.policy.manchester.ac.uk/posts/2022/06/online-safety-child-abuse-and-exploitation-in-extended-reality/) and abuse.  <BR><BR>[Singaporeans are the least optimistic](https://vulcanpost.com/775938/singaporeans-least-optimistic-about-metaverse-among-sea/) about the metaverse among those surveyed in Southeast Asia, citing issues of trust and privacy.

## Metaverse: A double-edged sword for users

While the metaverse could potentially enhance our lives in many ways, we need to be mindful that it can also negatively impact the quality of our lives. Here are some tips to safeguard yourself:

1. ### Reading before you enter the metaverse

###  

Companies may have public education reminders on privacy and content, take time to read before proceeding. Making [informed consent](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/23/opinions/metaverse-transformative-ethics-thomason-spc-intl/index.html) is one way to managing your personal data, funds or IP in the metaverse. Similar to how banks that make users read reminders before making online transactions, be sure of what you read, before taking action. 

 

2. ### Cyber safety should [start young](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/kids-action/articles/what-are-kids-doing-in-the-metaverse)

 

Prevention is better than cure.
