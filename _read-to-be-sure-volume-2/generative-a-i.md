Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm, and for good reason. It has gone mainstream and could revolutionise society and the economy as we know it. This technology has caused both [excitement and fear about the future](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/06/21/as-ai-spreads-experts-predict-the-best-and-worst-changes-in-digital-life-by-2035/). [72% of Singaporeans surveyed are excited](https://sg.style.yahoo.com/more-working-singaporeans-excited-generative-171604863.html?guccounter=1) to use GenAI at work, but 51% cited worries about jobs. 

Many people are excited because GenAI can create [new content](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/), including code, essays, images, social media posts, and videos. [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) garnered [100 million users](https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/chatgpt-openai-everyday-guide-17777804.php) in just two months after its launch. The possibilities seem limitless! 

With advancements in the technology, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between [human and machine-generated content](https://www.cutter.com/article/generative-ai-future-content-creation-tech-advisor), [fact and fiction](https://www.fastcompany.com/90873422/ai-feels-like-a-magic-act-by-2033-it-will-be-a-horror-movie). There is a lot of [hype and hysteria](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65162257) around GenAI. Enthusiasts argue that it could [transform](https://www.weforum.org/press/2023/05/breaking-down-barriers-business-academia-and-government-collaborate-on-generative-ai-development/) the world for the better as such tools are overcoming language barriers and automating tasks. There is potential for great impact in education. For example, it could help [teachers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/03/03/generative-ai-education-in-the-age-of-innovation/?sh=70e753d14eca) create interactive learning experiences for students and encourage [critical thinking in students](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/06/chatgpt-learning-tool). 

Pessimists predict [job disruption](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2023/03/31/goldman-sachs-predicts-300-million-jobs-will-be-lost-or-degraded-by-artificial-intelligence/?sh=1f287981782b), [increase wealth inequality](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/08/ai-chatgpt-jobs-economy-inequality), loss of privacy, and diminishing human intelligence. Critics say that GenAI [lacks creativity](https://www.voanews.com/a/artificial-intelligence-can-create-but-lacks-creativity-say-critics/7068177.html) and is [encroaching on creativity](https://itif.org/publications/2023/05/01/tech-panics-generative-ai-and-the-need-for-regulatory-caution/). IMDA’s [AI Verify Foundation](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/) identifies six [risks](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/downloads/Discussion_Paper.pdf), including mistakes and hallucinations, privacy and confidentiality, disinformation and cyber-threats, and embedded bias. 

GenAI is in its infancy and its [implications](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/downloads/Discussion_Paper.pdf) are not fully known. Some experts fear that it could be used for [malicious](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65855333) exploitation. Nevertheless, it has great potential to empower individuals and organisations. When used in a safe and responsible manner, this technology can unlock tremendous opportunities that transform many aspects of modern life. 

## So, is generative AI bringing more power or peril to society?

| **The power and promises of generative AI** <br><br>         | **The perils and challenges of generative AI**<br><br>       |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Generative AI could unleash the next productivity frontier and raise global GDP**<BR><BR>GenAI could revolutionise the way many[ jobs](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#introduction) are performed such as sales and marketing, customer operations, and software development. <BR><BR> Not only could it boost productivity, but it could also raise global GDP by 7% and increase productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period, according to [Goldman Sachs Research](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html). <BR><BR> But perhaps the most exciting thing about this technology is the way it promotes divergent thinking and [augments human creativity](https://hbr.org/2023/07/how-generative-ai-can-augment-human-creativity). By challenging expertise bias and helping us create unimaginable solutions, it opens up a whole new world of innovation.<BR><BR> | **Generative AI could cause major disruption for the labour market**  <BR><BR>Advances in AI could expose some [300 million jobs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html) worldwide to automation. In the U.S., two thirds of occupations could be partially automated, with a quarter of their workload replaced. However, most jobs and industries are likely to be complemented rather than replaced by AI. <BR><BR> While it’s true that GenAI will create many new jobs, it’s likely that many existing jobs will be altered, from entry-level positions to those at [professional](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/how-generative-ai-chatgpt-will-change-jobs-at-all-work-levels.html) levels, including the C-suite and middle managers. Workers need to start using AI now or [risk being left behind](https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2023/start-using-ai-now-or-risk-being-left-behind.html).<BR><BR>GenAI tools such as ChatGPT and Midjourney are threatening to disrupt the world of [content creation](https://hbr.org/2022/11/how-generative-ai-is-changing-creative-work), impacting on marketing, software, design, entertainment, and interpersonal communications.<BR><BR> |
| **Generative AI will accelerate innovation and [democratise AI](https://www.cutter.com/article/generative-artificial-intelligence-democratization-ai)**   <BR><BR> GenAI can unlock human creativity and potential as well as [transform](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/technology/generative-ai-summary) industries and increase innovation. Such tools, together with low-code software that does not require extensive coding, is [accelerating innovation](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/19/generative-ai-and-low-code-are-speeding-up-innovation.html) in organisations.  <BR><BR>Programmes such as DALL-E 2 could [democratise AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/14/1074434/asias-opportunity-for-generative-ai/) by putting it into the hands of every person and every organisation. ChatGPT and other similar programmes are [infiltrating workplaces](https://www.wsj.com/articles/generative-ai-is-already-changing-white-collar-work-as-we-know-it-58b53918?mod=article_inline). Workers are using GenAI tools to do their [jobs](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt-chatbot-jobs-3471791) better and [boost output](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/your-money-briefing/how-workers-are-using-generative-ai-tools-to-increase-productivity/CC1E39B3-D422-46CB-8162-46C1901C3260).    <BR><BR>A great number of Singaporean employees ([81%](https://www.asiaone.com/business/microsoft-work-trend-index-2023-singapore-data-unveils-opportunities-unlock-workplace)) would delegate as much work as possible to AI to lessen their workload. Most Singaporeans are comfortable using AI for analytical work ([87%](https://www.asiaone.com/business/microsoft-work-trend-index-2023-singapore-data-unveils-opportunities-unlock-workplace)), administrative tasks ([85%](https://www.asiaone.com/business/microsoft-work-trend-index-2023-singapore-data-unveils-opportunities-unlock-workplace)), and even creative work ([81%](https://www.asiaone.com/business/microsoft-work-trend-index-2023-singapore-data-unveils-opportunities-unlock-workplace)).<br/><br/> | **Human creativity still trumps generative AI**  <br><br/>Although GenAI is changing the nature of creativity, it’s not the [death knell for human creativity and originality](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/23/its-the-opposite-of-art-why-illustrators-are-furious-about-ai). AI won’t replace [human ingenuity](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/15/adobe-ceo-says-ai-will-wont-replace-human-ingenuity-itll-augment-it.html), it only enhances [creativity](https://www.fastcompany.com/90877017/generative-ai-will-change-the-world-but-wont-put-creative-jobs-at-risk) and efficiency.    Most artists, writers and musicians believe GenAI cannot replicate [human expression](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/05/26/how-generative-ai-is-changing-creative-work/?sh=7ffa3c54d9ca) that goes into a creative work. The written word, music and art are vehicles to express thoughts and share emotions, and despite how powerful this technology may be, it cannot replace our [urge to create](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/05/26/how-generative-ai-is-changing-creative-work/?sh=7ffa3c54d9ca) or human creators.   <BR><BR>GenAI cannot replicate all the intricacies of human expressions and artistic expression. A creative work that connects with a human deeply will always require a [creative human](https://www.wired.com/story/picture-limitless-creativity-ai-image-generators/) in the loop. AI can automate and accelerate, but it’s the [human touch](https://medium.com/@ibrahimandcompany/valuing-the-human-touch-ai-authenticity-and-the-future-of-original-content-7b44e9b5d66d) that infuses authenticity and depth into our creations. |
| **Generative AI will change our daily lives for the better**   <br><br>GenAI will free people up for more creative and intellectually fulfilling activities, leading more [human-centric lives](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/05/ai-work-creative/). It could, for example, deliver [personalised](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/03/03/generative-ai-education-in-the-age-of-innovation/?sh=4fdd1a4c4eca) learning content for students and provide real-time feedback fostering their growth.   <br/><br/>It could transform healthcare, including personalised medication and care. [Generative AI algorithms](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/05/how-will-generative-ai-impact-healthcare/) could analyse data detected by wearables in managing diseases like cardiovascular diseases. It could be used as a medical triage application that provides [plain English answers](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00216-7/fulltext) patients’ questions.   <br/><br/>Individuals  who need [help with everyday stressors](https://www.psychologytoday.com/sg/blog/the-doctor-of-the-future/202303/generative-ai-could-help-solve-the-us-mental-health-crisis), such as issues with time management, personal life, or economic uncertainty, can use AI chatbots to point them to on-demand resources. Companies are using [AI-powered mental health tools](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/01/heres-how-ai-backed-tools-can-help-worker-stress-and-mental-health.html) to help workers manage their stress and burnout. | **Generative AI could hurt society**    <br><br>GenAI could cause [problems in society](https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/4037499-generative-ai-is-not-entertainment-it-is-already-a-threat-to-our-way-of-life/) if left unchecked. It could have key consequences on our public health, democracy, economy, and infrastructure. Other risks include its proneness to “[hallucinations](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/31/openai-is-pursuing-a-new-way-to-fight-ai-hallucinations.html)” that fabricate information entirely; and being used to create [misinformation](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/will-ai-generated-images-create-new-crisis-fact-checkers-experts-are-not-so-sure) or [disinformation](https://ijnet.org/en/story/how-ai-generated-images-are-complicating-efforts-combat-disinformation) making [social media](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/generative-ai-social-media-integration-dangers-disinformation-addiction/673940/) more damaging. AI could also be used by students to [cheat](https://www.harvardonline.harvard.edu/blog/benefits-limitations-generative-ai) on exams and essays.   <br><br>AI tools are increasingly used to support people’s health needs, including providing [therapy](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-chatbots-could-help-provide-therapy-but-caution-is-needed/). But the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news/item/16-05-2023-who-calls-for-safe-and-ethical-ai-for-health) urges caution in using AI generated large language model (LLM) tools to protect human well-being, safety, and preserve public health. When the risks of LLMs are not fully examined, it could lead to errors by healthcare workers and cause harms to patients.<br><br>It could also [harm](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00216-7/fulltext) our mental health due to perpetuating biases relating to [race](https://www.vox.com/technology/23738987/racism-ai-automated-bias-discrimination-algorithm), [gender](https://www.cigionline.org/articles/generative-ai-tools-are-perpetuating-harmful-gender-stereotypes/), nationality and age occurring in natural language processing computer programmes, which understand human language as it’s written and spoken. |
