Gender equality provides equal rights, opportunities and responsibilities to people regardless of gender. Although there has been progress over the years, the challenges remain with a persistent gap in access to opportunities and empowerment between men and women across the world. 

 

In Singapore, [women earned 4.3 percent less](https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Update-on-Singapores-Adjusted-Gender-Pay-Gap.aspx) than men in 2020. Women also face various types of physical, sexual, and online harm. A 2021 survey showed that [2 in 5 workers](https://www.aware.org.sg/training/wsh-site/14-statistics/) encountered some form of workplace sexual harassment in the preceding five years. Such harassment has extended to the online space as well, with [163 new cases](https://www.aware.org.sg/2022/04/image-based-sexual-abuse-featured-in-7-in-10-cases-of-technology-facilitated-sexual-violence-seen-by-aware-in-2021/) of technology-facilitated sexual violence against women reported in 2021.  

 

Gender equality is key to a safer and healthier community, equal and inclusive society, and economic prosperity. To achieve this, we need to shift our mindsets, abolish patriarchal values, and empower women.
