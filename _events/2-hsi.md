Organised by the National Library Board and supported by the Ministry of Education (Humanities Branch, History Unit), the Historical Scene Investigation (HSI) Challenge is an inter-school contest in which students put their historical inquiry and research skills to the test. 

Opened to lower secondary school students, 2022’s theme commemorated the 80th anniversary of the Fall of Singapore, in which students investigated the historical significance of the Second World War in Singapore between 1942 to 1945. Each team was required to create a video to highlight their historical investigation findings, along with a written report with cited sources.

A record participation of 170 teams from 82 schools participated in the contest and the submissions showcased the students’ creativity and aptitude in their historical research.
