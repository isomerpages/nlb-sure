Gender equality provides equal rights, opportunities and responsibilities to people regardless of gender. Although there has been progress over the years, the challenges remain with a persistent gap in access to opportunities and empowerment between men and women across the world. 

 

In Singapore, women earned 4.3 percent less than men in 2020[[1\]](#_ftn1). Women also face various types of physical, sexual, and online harm. A 2021 survey showed that 2 in 5 workers encountered some form of workplace sexual harassment in the preceding five years.[[2\]](#_ftn2) Such harassment has extended to the online space as well, with 163 new cases of technology-facilitated sexual violence against women reported in 2021.
