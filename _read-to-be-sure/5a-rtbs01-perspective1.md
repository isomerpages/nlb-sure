In 2019, [65   million people](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/documents/briefingnote/wcms_758626.pdf) worked in the [APAC   clothing manufacturing industry](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_dialogue/---sector/documents/publication/wcms_669355.pdf) – that’s  every seven out of 10 people of all workers worldwide.

No wonder the industry is key to the economic and social  development of many developing countries.
