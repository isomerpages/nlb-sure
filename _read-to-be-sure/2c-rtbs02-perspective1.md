While the pandemic started unexpectedly, the world has begun to accept that it has fully transformed our daily routine. Today’s toddlers relate wearing masks to going out, and terms like “circuit breaker”, “lockdown” and “quarantine” have become mainstream. The world came to a standstill as governments took similar approaches to deal with the unknown. Public health resource considerations and a desire to prevent the spread of the virus spurred zero-COVID strategies, despite differences in political systems and development levels. 



Countries such as Australia, China, Hong Kong, Macau, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam backed policies aimed at [eliminating COVID‑19](https://www.eiu.com/n/asias-transition-away-from-zero-covid/) through strict containment measures, extensive testing, contact tracing and firm international border controls. Such efforts strived to curb the spread of the virus.

 

While today most of the world expects COVID-19 to become [endemic](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), [China](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-is-more-dedicated-than-ever-to-covid-19-zero-as-it-battles-delta) continues to maintain this approach. [Public support](https://research.nus.edu.sg/eai/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/06/EAIBB-No.-1535-Life_political-opinions_COVID-19-lockdown-Chengdu-n-Wuhan-2.pdf) for the zero-COVID approach in China appears strong, possibly due to the [social stigma and discrimination](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.694988/full) of those who contract COVID-19. A study even estimates that China would have to cope with over [600,000 cases a day](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-study-warns-of-colossal-covid-19-outbreak-if-it-opens-up-like-us-france) if travel restrictions are lifted, highlighting China’s argument that its approach is one driven by necessity. 

 

<details>    <summary><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal;">What are the possible risks from having fewer restrictions?</span></summary>
<br>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:normal">Optimistic projections estimate that by mid-2022, death and disease rates for COVID-19 may be <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/covid-19-infection-and-death-rates-should-be-on-a-par-with-seasonal-flu-by-mid-2022-bill"></a>lower than that of the seasonal common fluhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/covid-19-infection-and-death-rates-should-be-on-a-par-with-seasonal-flu-by-mid-2022-bill owing to the increase in global immunity resulting from high vaccination rates of a population, or moderate vaccination levels coupled with significant prior COVID-19 infections. As a result, this has encouraged the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in many countries across the globe. <br>Yet, the capacities of public health systems remain a concern for most governments, who resort to keeping a close watch on COVID-19 case numbers, ready to re-impose restrictions whenever deemed necessary. People and businesses are thus <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj-2021-067508">caught in confusion</a> when these policies are adjusted.  <br>Additionally, while there is a resumption of international activities as borders open up following vaccine rollouts, the lack of harmonised <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/iata-repository/pressroom/presentations/restarting-global-travel-agm2021/">border measures</a>, restrictions and procedures is a cause of confusion for travellers—who resort to finalising plans as late as possible to keep up <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/travelers-are-waiting-till-last-minute-to-book-flights/47158012">with rapidly changing regulations</a>, incited by new virus strands. <a href="https://worldrepublicnews.com/as-international-travel-returns-confusion-reigns-over-vaccines/">Fragmented rules</a> about vaccine acceptance, documentation, as well as testing requirements are costly and difficult to navigate.  <br>The return to normalcy is fragile. Countries that are reopening faster have reported a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2021-067508">higher death toll</a> in the earlier stages of the pandemic. As individuals begin to integrate back into society — balancing their work and personal lives — the risks of cluster infections remain. <a href="https://www.fidh.org/en/issues/international-justice/covid-19-spreading-faster-than-vaccines-rich-countries-must-address">Vaccine inequality</a> also remains a concern, especially as it creates unvaccinated pockets where the virus can continue to mutate and spread. </span></details>



<details>    <summary><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal;">What are the downsides to having more restrictions?</span></summary>
<br>
    <span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:normal">Countries fear <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/30/people-are-starting-to-wane-china-zero-covid-policy-takes-toll">being left behind</a> in social and economic pursuits as the zero-tolerance strategy has a significant impact on work and life for millions of people. 
<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/moving-from-covid-19-pandemic-to-endemic">Singapore</a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/10/16/how-long-can-chinas-zero-covid-policy-last">Australia, New Zealand</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/zero-covid-worked-for-some-countries-but-high-vaccine-coverage-is-now-key-169327">Vietnam</a>, for example, have shifted their prior zero-COVID policy approach as scientists expect that COVID-19 will become endemic over time – meaning that it will continue to circulate within pockets of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2">global population</a> for years to come. 73% of the respondents of a <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2021-releases/2021-10-05-01/">survey</a> conducted by the International Air Transport Association reported that their quality of life was suffering due to travel restrictions. They had missed many “family moments, personal development opportunities and business priorities.”</span></details>
