![](../images/rtbs-01b-perspective2a.JPG)

Consumers love the instant gratification fast fashion provides. Getting their hands on [the latest fashion trends](https://www.drapersonline.com/news/how-the-desire-for-instant-gratification-is-shaping-retail) within a short time seems too good to be true. Yet this is what the industry delivers, and at affordable prices to boot. Throughout the years, clothing prices have gone as [low as S$3 to S$15](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cnainsider/true-cost-demand-cheap-clothes-fast-fashion-industry-environment-220706) in Singapore. Thatâ€™s almost as cheap as your daily lunch or dinner. Keep in mind fast fashion companies have also been producing items in [a wide range of sizes](https://ww.fashionnetwork.com/news/Mango-completes-violeta-integration-shein-tops-plus-size-inclusivity-list,1327389.html) to cater to different body shapes.

Fast fashion continues to grow to keep up with rising demand and rapidly changing fashion trends. One has to stop and wonder what the drawbacks are?
