As people around the world queue up for vaccine shots, some dream of finally being able to [attend football games](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-02/premier-league-soccer-crowds-pack-stadiums-like-never-before) or live music events, while others simply hope this means they can buy groceries safely.
