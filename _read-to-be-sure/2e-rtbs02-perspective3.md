As people around the world queue up for vaccine shots, some dream of finally being able to [attend football games](https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-02/premier-league-soccer-crowds-pack-stadiums-like-never-before) or live music events, while others simply hope this means they can buy groceries safely. The approach towards easing stringent measure varies from country to country — while some opt for a gradual opening, others have lifted measures altogether.  

 

Gradual reopening and public health measures such as mandatory wearing of masks indoors, indoor capacity restrictions, social distancing, and implementing [vaccine passports](https://theconversation.com/vaccine-passports-why-they-are-good-for-society-160419) are some strategies that countries can adopt.

Norway said that “the time has come to return to a [normal daily life](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/norway-end-coronavirus-related-restrictions-saturday-2021-09-24/)” and does not require proof of vaccination for citizens to enter nightclubs, bars or restaurants. [Sweden](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/sweden-lifts-all-covid-19-restrictions/2378287) also abolished all COVID-19 related restrictions, announcing that the pandemic has been brought under control.
