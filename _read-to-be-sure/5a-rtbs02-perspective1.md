The clothing manufacturing industry employs many and creates millions of jobs. Buying your next T-shirt could feed households and reduce poverty in many countries in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, also known as “the clothing factory of the world”. In 2019, [65 million people](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/documents/briefingnote/wcms_758626.pdf) worked in the [APAC clothing manufacturing industry](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_dialogue/---sector/documents/publication/wcms_669355.pdf) — that’s every seven out of 10 workers worldwide.
