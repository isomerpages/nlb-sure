Let’s say you head down to a store to get your fashion fix. Immediately, some clothes nearby catch your eye. You spot the tag and are taken aback by the high price. When you look closer, you spot it — a sticker labelled “Sustainable Fashion”.



This is why sustainable fashion may not be trendy or affordable. They tend to [be more expensive](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cnainsider/true-cost-demand-cheap-clothes-fast-fashion-industry-environment-220706) due to their small batch production and extensive manufacturing processes. Some consumers are more likely to [pay premium prices](https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/what-is-slow-fashion) for going [eco-friendly](https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/sustainable-fashion-affordable). There is also a [lack of size inclusivity](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/a32213676/plus-size-sustainable-fashion/) in sustainable fashion, with consumers [facing difficulty](https://fashionjournal.com.au/fashion/the-sustainable-fashion-industry-is-size-exclusive-take-it-from-this-model/) in finding the right fit.

Finally, you decide to buy a sustainable shirt. On the way home, you suddenly spot headlines of the brand being exposed for child labour. Weren’t they supposed to be ‘sustainable’? Research might be required as some companies use [misleading marketing tactics and false sustainability claims](http://changingmarkets.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SyntheticsAnonymous_FinalWeb.pdf) to get you to buy their products.
