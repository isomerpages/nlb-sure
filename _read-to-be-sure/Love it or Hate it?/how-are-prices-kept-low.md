Getting your hands on [the latest fashion trends](https://www.drapersonline.com/news/how-the-desire-for-instant-gratification-is-shaping-retail) within a short time seems too good to be true. Yet this is what the industry delivers, and at affordable prices to boot.

How do they do it? 

Vertically integrated supply chains allow fast fashion producers [greater control of everything](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cnainsider/true-cost-demand-cheap-clothes-fast-fashion-industry-environment-220706) from fabrics to logistics. Outsourcing manufacturing to [low-cost countries offers bargain deals](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hidden-cost-of-cheap-fashion-could-catch-up-to-investors-zara-old-navy-11621556298) to consumers across the globe. Cheaper prices have been linked not only to [cheap](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/fast-fashion-manufacturing-cheap-modern-slavery-913181) labour but [child labour](https://labs.theguardian.com/unicef-child-labour/) as well. 

This industry continues to grow to keep up with rising demand and rapidly changing fashion trends. One has to stop and wonder: At what cost?
