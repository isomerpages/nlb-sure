### **About the SURE campaign**

The  [National Library Board](http://www.nlb.gov.sg/) ’s (NLB) S.U.R.E programme, first launched in 2013, promotes the importance of information searching and discernment to the general public. The acronym stands for Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate – four concepts that an individual should keep in mind when assessing the reliability of news. NLB has since upgraded its S.U.R.E programme to become S.U.R.E. 2.0 – S.U.R.E for School; S.U.R.E. for Work; and S.U.R.E. for Life – to cater to the different needs and segments of the population.

 S.U.R.E. distills key Information Literacy (IL) concepts into 4 simple ways:

* **S**ource: Look as its origins. Is it trustworthy?
* **U**nderstand: Know what you’re reading. Search for clarity.
* **R**esearch: Dig deeper. Go beyond the initial source.
* **E**valuate: Find the balance. Exercise fair judgement.
