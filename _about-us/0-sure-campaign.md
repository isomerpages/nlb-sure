### **About the SURE campaign**

The SURE campaign is an initiative by the [National Library Board](http://www.nlb.gov.sg/) to promote the importance of information searching and discernment. The nation-wide campaign was launched in 2013, and Singapore is the first country outside of the United States to promote Information Literacy (IL) on a national scale for the general public.

S.U.R.E. distills key Information Literacy (IL) concepts into 4 simple ways:
* **S**ource: Look as its origins. Is it trustworthy?
* **U**nderstand: Know what you’re reading. Search for clarity.
* **R**esearch: Dig deeper. Go beyond the initial source.
* **E**valuate: Find the balance. Exercise fair judgement.

#### **Who we are and What we do**

We get people to start thinking about the information they receive every day and its sources through awareness marketing, training and engaging the public.
