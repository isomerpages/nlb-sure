### **S.U.R.E. for Work - Learning Journey & Workshop**

![Banner for SURE for work - learning journey & workshop](/images/banner-learning-journey.png)

The National Library promotes Information Literacy skills amongst Singaporeans, through the S.U.R.E. 2.0 campaign, namely:-

* **Source** – Look at its origins. Is it trustworthy?
* **Understand** – Know what you are reading. Search for clarity.
* **Research** – Dig deeper. Go beyond the initial source.
* **Evaluate** – Find the balance. Exercise fair judgement.

This is a FREE programme that will enable you and your colleagues to find and evaluate credible resources as well as prepare simple research reports. Participants will learn to use various techniques to search for trusted and reliable sources of information, and to be more discerning in the information they use.

You are encouraged to bring your own mobile devices to try out the various electronic resources.
