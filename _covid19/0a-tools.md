**Fact-checking Tools** 

Here are some useful online resources you can use to conduct basic fact-checks on dubious information concerning COVID-19:



## (A) FACT-CHECKERS

### SINGAPORE

If the dubious information you received mentioned something specific to Singapore, you can refer to the following websites first:

- [MOH > Clarifications on Misinformation regarding COVID-19](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/clarifications) provides succinct clarifications regarding to COVID-19 rumours and fake news in Singapore, with links to relevant sources in some cases.  
- [Factually > Clarifications on misinformation regarding the Coronavirus disease 2019](https://www.gov.sg/article/covid-19-clarifications) -   this is useful for tracking COVID-19 misinformation debunked by Ministries and government agencies.  Do check the [in-depth articles](https://www.gov.sg/factually) and [POFMA cases](https://www.gov.sg/factually?topic=POFMA) listed in the main Factually page.



Local media websites also debunk fake news, though not all of them are exclusively about COVID-19:

- [The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/tags/fake-news)
- [Zaobao](https://www.zaobao.com.sg/keywords/fake-news)
- [STOMP](https://stomp.straitstimes.com/tag/stomp-fights-fake-news)
- [Channel NewsAsia](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topic/fake-news)
- [Mothership](https://mothership.sg/category/fake-news/)



Local fact-checking groups have also risen to the occasion:

- [Black Dot Research FactCheck](https://blackdotresearch.sg/covid-watch/) aims to "*verify claims made from any source that could potentially cause a seismic shift in public perception on topics of general importance in Singapore*". You can read their COVIDWatch articles which debunk fake news such as [*Did someone get fined $300 for sitting on a demarcated seat at Ya Kun?*](https://blackdotresearch.sg/covidwatch-did-someone-get-fined-300-for-sitting-on-a-demarcated-seat-at-ya-kun/) and [*Is Singapore ceasing imports of supplies and heading for a lockdown?*](https://blackdotresearch.sg/covidwatch-is-singapore-ceasing-imports-of-supplies-and-heading-for-a-lockdown/)

  

- [Sure Anot](https://www.facebook.com/SureAnotSG/) - is a ground-up campaign started by a group of NTU students that hopes to educate Singaporeans on fake news. You can sign up for their WhatsApp chat group [HERE](https://chat.whatsapp.com/ETW4jTdfiJP5XibO6ctZ6V).

### INTERNATIONAL

Sometimes, you may receive fake news which do not mention anything specific about Singapore, or which may have been copied and edited to appear as if it happened in Singapore. You can check against the following fact-checking websites:

- [The Coronavirus Collection: Fact-Checking COVID-19](https://www.snopes.com/collections/new-coronavirus-collection/) -  fact-checked claims listed in categories such as [*Origins and Spread*](https://www.snopes.com/collections/coronavirus-origins-treatments/), [*Prevention & Treatments*](https://www.snopes.com/collections/coronavirus-collection-prevention-treatments/),  and [*Viral Videos*](https://www.snopes.com/collections/coronavirus-collection-videos/).
- [Reuters Fact Check](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check) - useful for international fake news, such as: 
  [*Bill Gates planning to use microchip implants to fight coronavirus*](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-coronavirus-bill-gates-micr/false-claim-bill-gates-planning-to-use-microchip-implants-to-fight-coronavirus-idUSKBN21I3EC) or [*In China the coronavirus only hit Wuhan, Chinese stock market unaffected*](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-coronavirus-only-hit-wuhan/false-claim-in-china-the-coronavirus-only-hit-wuhan-chinese-stock-market-unaffected-idUSKBN21J6MT)
- [AFP Fact Check](https://factcheck.afp.com/search?keyword=covid) - by news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP), you can refer to articles about Singapore, such as [*Singaporean authorities refute hoax about 'spot fines' for people violating social distancing orders*](https://factcheck.afp.com/singaporean-authorities-refute-hoax-about-spot-fines-people-violating-social-distancing-orders), or international cases like [*Health experts warn against mixing rum, bleach and fabric softener to make 'hand sanitiser'*](https://factcheck.afp.com/health-experts-warn-against-mixing-rum-bleach-and-fabric-softener-make-hand-sanitiser).

## (B) NEWS AGGREGATORS

Important COVID-19 news will be reported in multiple news sources, instead of the odd one or two alternative news.sites, blogs or forwarded messages. You can refer to individual news websites, or news aggregators such as:

- [Google News](https://news.google.com/topstories?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG:en) - This gives you an overview of relevant news from multiple news websites. You can narrow down to news about [COVID-19](https://news.google.com/search?q=covid-19&hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen) or [Singapore](https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqIQgKIhtDQkFTRGdvSUwyMHZNRFowTW5RU0FtVnVLQUFQAQ?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen). 
- [PressReader](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/Browse?browseBy=type&filter=13) - This database provides FREE access to thousands of the worldâ€™s leading newspapers and magazines from more than 100 countries in 60 languages. Publications are presented as full digital replicas and offer advanced digital features such as keyword searching, translation, audio functionality and much more. ***This is available at all libraries and from home, using your NLB myLibrary ID account (note: The Business Times, The Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao are available in libraries only).***

## (C) REVERSE IMAGE SEARCH

- [Google Reverse Image Search](https://images.google.com/) - This is useful for checking if images you received were taken from other websites (e.g. stock images or old news articles), and used as part of the fake news. If you received a video, you can also take screen shots of a few key segments, and perform a reverse image search as well.  Instructions for Android, Computer and iPhone can be found [HERE](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en).
- [Yandex Images](https://yandex.com/images/) - This Russian website is similar to Google in terms of doing a reverse image search: you can either upload an image from your device, or enter the image URL. An additional feature is the ability to crop an image on the fly and do another round of reverse image search on the newly cropped version.
