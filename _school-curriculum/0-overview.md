Welcome to the new S.U.R.E. curriculum on digital media and information literacy, digital safety and digital wellness!

 

This new curriculum aim to equip our students with essential knowledge and skills to navigate the complex information landscape in today’s digital age. S.U.R.E. stands for Source, Understand, Research and Evaluate, which are key concepts that will be covered in the first part of the curriculum under “Information Literacy”.

 

The learning materials are catered to students at various levels of education:

- Basic Level – For primary schools
- Intermediate Level – For secondary schools
- Advanced – For pre-university and junior colleges

 

To facilitate different learning styles, the educational resources cover a range of materials in different formats, including videos, case studies, infographics and presentation slides. These materials can be used in blended learning approach, allowing students to work at their own pace and access them any time or facilitated by teachers in the classroom.
