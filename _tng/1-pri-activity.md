**Primary School Activity 1: Early Editions**

Singaporeâ€™s first newspaper, Singapore Chronicle and Commercial Register, was founded in 1824. It remained the only local newspaper for more than a decade due to the [Gagging Act](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_88_2005-02-03.html), which banned any publication that was not approved by the authorities.

To cater to the needs of different communities in Singapore, newspapers in various languages were also published. 

The National Library is home to a rich archive of over 200 Singapore newspaper titles published since 1827. You can explore these old editions and more on [Newspaper SG](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers).
