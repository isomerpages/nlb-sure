| ![](https://sure.nlb.gov.sg/images/SUREvivor_Sarah.jpg) | Hi! I’m **Source-Finding Sarah.** I have my tablet computer, books and maps to help me examine [various sources](https://sure.nlb.gov.sg/tng/surevivors-activity3/) first before believing them. I always check out where my information comes from before trusting what they say! |
|                                    |                                                              |
| ![](https://sure.nlb.gov.sg/images/SUREvivor_Upin.jpg)  | I’m **Understanding Upin**! I always make sure that I know what I’m reading and spend time thinking about whether the information is backed up by evidence (or *proof*). I often think to myself while reading, “Is this a [fact or someone’s point-of-view](https://sure.nlb.gov.sg/tng/surevivors-activity5/)?”. Sometimes I also wonder about the reasons [why someone writes about something](https://sure.nlb.gov.sg/tng/surevivors-activity6/). |

| ![](https://sure.nlb.gov.sg/images/SUREvivor_Raju.jpg)  | Hello! I’m **Researching Raju.** When I do my research, I dig deeper and [search for different credible sources](https://sure.nlb.gov.sg/tng/surevivors-activity7/) to cross-check that my information is correct, just like a detective! My motto is, “Always cross check your information!”. |
|                                    |                                                              |
| ![](https://sure.nlb.gov.sg/images/SUREvivor_Emma.jpg)  | I’m **Evaluating Emma**! This is my favourite t-shirt because it has the “scale of justice” and reminds me to weigh all the different sides to a news story. With my handy checklist and clipboard, I make sure to look at all angles before coming to my own opinion! |
