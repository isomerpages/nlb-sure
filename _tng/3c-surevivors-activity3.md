**Primary and Secondary Sources**

Primary sources are first-hand accounts of events or time periods. These sources, such as diaries and letters, are usually records directly from the person who experienced the events or lived during a particular time. Primary sources also include interviews, audio and video recordings as well as original documents like birth certificates.



Secondary sources often describe or explain primary sources. For example, dictionaries, encyclopaedias and opinion pieces in newspapers are considered to be secondary sources. The writer of a secondary source can provide his or her interpretation and analysis of events or a time period based on primary sources. A secondary source can include references to both primary and secondary sources, while a primary source does not. For example, an encyclopaedia entry on an individual can contain references to their personal handwritten letters. Newspaper articles written about the person may also be included as references in the same encyclopaedia entry.

 

Both primary and secondary sources can be found in the non-fiction and reference sections of the library. To help library users find resources in the library, materials are assigned specific call numbers. Non-fiction and reference books usually have numerical call numbers, like in the example below. The call numbers for fiction titles use alphabets. However, some fiction books have numerical call numbers in the 800s, so be sure to check!
