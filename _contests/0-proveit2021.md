Organised by the National Library Board, the S.U.R.E. Prove It! Contest 2021 aimed to equip students with information literacy skills in the digital age and apply it to current affairs consumed online. 

Opened to lower secondary school students, 2021 was a special year for the contest as it was the first time that student teams were tasked with creating a video about the S.U.R.E. (Source, Understand, Research, Evaluate) steps and promote it in their respective schools in an advocacy effort to promote good information discernment habits. Supporting partners for 2021 included Black Dot Research, helmed by Mr Nicholas Fang (Managing Director), and Prof. Edson Tandoc Jr. from the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information at Nanyang Technological University. 

A total of 27 schools participated in the contest, in which a delightful mix of videos were submitted which showcased the students’ creativity and aptitude in covering the S.U.R.E. steps. The advocacy efforts by all the teams were shared via a written report.
