The S.U.R.E. Prove It! Contest 2021 (24 May - 4 Aug 2021) is organised by the National Library Board and aims to equip students with information literacy skills in the digital age and apply it to current affairs consumed online. Through their knowledge and creativity, teams will create a short video about ways to apply the S.U.R.E. steps and promote the video in their respective schools to become effective advocates of information literacy.  This contest is open to all lower secondary students, and each school can register ONE team of four students.
