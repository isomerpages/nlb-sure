Organised by the National Library Board and supported by the Ministry of Education (Humanities Branch, History Unit), the Historical Scene Investigation (HSI) Challenge is an inter-school contest in which students put their historical inquiry and research skills to the test. 

Opened to lower secondary school students, 2021 was a special year for the contest as it was aligned to the *[Human x Nature: Environmental Histories of Singapore](https://exhibitions.nlb.gov.sg/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/humanxnature/)* exhibition at the National Library. Each team was required to create a video to highlight their historical investigation findings, along with a written report with cited sources.

A total of 59 schools participated in the contest and the submissions showcased the students’ creativity and aptitude in their historical research.
