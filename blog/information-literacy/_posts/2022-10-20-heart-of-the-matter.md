This programme is part of the National Library Board’s S.U.R.E. Celebrates Media and Information Literacy (or M.I.L.) event.

 

In this workshop, Nisha Rai, co-president of safeNUS, shared tips to equip us with basic understanding of what constitutes online harms, in particular, technology-facilitated sexual violent (TFSV), concepts of consent, respect and boundaries, and how one can be an effective peer supporter.
