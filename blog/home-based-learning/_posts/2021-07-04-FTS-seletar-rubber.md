**ABOUT THIS VIDEO**

What do sleepy Sembawang Road shophouses have to do with London’s hot international stock markets? The answer: “ulu” rubber plantations. In the mid-1890s, Henry Ridley, director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, persuaded Chinese merchant Tan Chay Yan to start planting rubber on a commercial scale. This inspired another businessman, Tan Kah Kee, to grow rubber plants along with his pineapples in his estate in Selatar. Explore the Seletar Rubber Estates with Senior Librarian Timothy Pwee through our collection of business documents and letters.
