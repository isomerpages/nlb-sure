What do sleepy Sembawang Road shophouses have to do with London’s hot international stock markets? The answer: “ulu” rubber plantations. In the mid-1890s, Henry Ridley, director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, persuaded Chinese merchant Tan Chay Yan to start planting rubber on a commercial scale. This inspired another businessman, Tan Kah Kee, to grow rubber plants along with his pineapples in his estate in Selatar.
