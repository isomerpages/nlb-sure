**ABOUT THIS VIDEO**

Senior librarian Ong Eng Chuan takes a look at Letters from Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles to Lord Lansdowne, written between 1820 and 1823 to garner support for Rafflesâ€™s efforts to secure Singapore as a British trading base in the Malay Archipelago. The letters offer a valuable first-hand account of Singapore in its early days as a British settlement and how it was already becoming an important commercial port, with over 100 ships sailing in to trade.
