**ABOUT THIS VIDEO**

Librarian Lee Meiyu and archivist Fiona Tan present "The Syonan Shimbun", an English newspaper published during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. Together with its Chinese imprint 昭南日报"Zhaonan Ribao", it was integral to the dissemination of news and information about Japanese rule and culture across Japanese-occupied Malaya. It carried official notices, wartime propaganda and price lists of essential goods. Today, it serves as a historic record of the suffering that people went through during the Japanese Occupation.
