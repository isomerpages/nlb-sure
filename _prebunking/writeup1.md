In January 2020, a fake health advisory was circulated on alternative news sites, purportedly from the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH). It went viral over many social media platforms and caused major concern and confusion in the community.

 

The advice claimed that the outbreak of the flu virus at that period was more severe than expected and that Singaporeans should take extra protection against influenza. It came with unproven examples on what should be done to avoid getting infected. On top of all these, there were no relevant authority or reliable sources cited in the advice. In a statement published in [The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/moh-advice-on-how-not-to-catch-influenza-is-a-hoax), MOH debunked the contents and made it clear that they did not issue the advisory. 

 

**THE SPREAD OF FAKE NEWS**

Health-related falsehoods are rampant on digital and social media platforms. They are spread with the deliberate intent to mislead and deceive, to cause undue worry and panic, preying on public fear. 

 

**IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY & SOCIAL MEDIA ALGORITHM**

Today, we are bombarded with an overwhelming amount of information over social platforms, which we often end up sharing with others. Most of the time the content is harmless, but we also share what we think is important without checking their authenticity. This is how fake news thrives and spreads.

 

What drives this rapid spread is algorithm. Behind every post, video or story that is shared on the internet, there is an algorithm designed to enhance the user experience. The more you search for information on the web, the better the algorithms get at generating data it believes is suitable for you, as it focuses on your profile, specifically your interests. 

 

This rising trend has swept the internet. High-tech giants and many other businesses are now doing this invisible, algorithmic editing of the web to personalise information that fits you. For example, if you and a friend were to search for the same topic on the web, your results will vary, depending on the browser you use, the computer you’re on, your location — all to customise your query results. Your browsing can give rise to fake news being a part of your search results, depending on what the algorithms have picked for you.

 

**THE DAMAGING EFFECTS OF DISINFORMATION**

Online falsehoods can have a harmful impact on human lives — social, political, emotional and economic. Businesses can shut down; lives can be ruined, all because of some false story going around the social networks. 

 

In the second quarter of 2018, fake news had caused the death of two young and well-educated men – Nilotpal Das, a 29-year old musician and his businessman friend, Abhijeet Nath, 30. A smartphone footage of them, blood-soaked and pleading for their lives were shared on popular social media and messaging platforms before they succumbed to their injuries. 

 

Sadly, these two men were victims of viral rumours about child traffickers that had spread through social media in that area. Crazed villagers had attacked them without verifying the facts. Indian officials blamed a [messaging platform](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/death-by-fake-news-social-media-fuelled-lynchings-shock-india), with over 200 million Indian users, for the “irresponsible and explosive messages”. The incident highlights the dangerous consequences of misinformation and the need for individuals and platforms to take responsibility for the information they share.
