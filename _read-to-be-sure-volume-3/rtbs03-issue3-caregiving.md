In Singapore, [caregivers](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-edwin-tong-senior-minister-of-state-for-health-in-response-to-motions-on-support-for-caregivers-and-ageing-with-purpose) are the unsung heroes of society, providing vital support to seniors, children and persons with disabilities (PwDs). Yet all too often their contributions remain invisible.  

Caregivers have complex and diverse needs. Some are potentially at risk of [caregiver burden](https://journals.lww.com/smj/fulltext/2022/10000/caregiver_burden_and_its_prevalence,_measurement.7.aspx). For example, caregivers often encounter difficulties in taking care of their relatives with [intellectual disabilities](https://cfps.org.sg/publications/the-singapore-family-physician/article/1844_pdf) (ID) and worry about [the future and challenges of future planning](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jppi.12441).

While [services for autistic children](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/special-needs-education-inclusiveness-work-progress-big-read-3405306) have grown substantially, services for autistic adults and their caregivers is still a work in progress. Demand for [adult services](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/reader/10.1177/13623613211016112) exceeds supply in residential or respite care, resulting in up to a [five-year wait](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/funding-staff-limits-cause-up-to-five-year-wait-at-centres-for-adults-with-autism) for placement at day activity centres.

Come 2030, [1 in 4 Singaporeans](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/PM-Lee-Hsien-Loong-at-the-Singapore-Ageing-Issues-and-Challenges-Ahead-Book-Launch) will be aged 65 and above. With [low birth](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-s-birth-rates-hit-record-low-in-2022-along-with-most-yearly-deaths-since-1960) rates and [increased life expectancy,](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/allnews/super-aged-singapore-society) the [rapid ageing population](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapores-population-ageing-rapidly-184-of-citizens-are-65-years-and-older) will have significant implications for caregiving, including fewer family members supporting older adults and a growing “[sandwich generation](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sandwich-generation-money-elderly-parents-children-singapore-population-2970826)” caring for both children and older family members.

[Caregivers](https://journals.lww.com/smj/fulltext/2022/10000/caregiver_burden_and_its_prevalence,_measurement.7.aspx) need concerted and [targeted support](https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12913-022-08317-3.pdf) as they provide multidimensional care, including physical, medical, financial, psychological and social assistance. The government has introduced policies to enhance access to care such as [CareShield Life](https://www.careshieldlife.gov.sg/home.html), [Home Caregiving Grant](https://www.moh.gov.sg/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/caregiver-grants-subsidies), [Active Aging Care Hubs](https://aic-mosaic.sg/2021/06/03/active-ageing-centre-care-hub-aac-aach-singapore-seniors/), as well as [Caregiver Support Action Plan](https://www.moh.gov.sg/caregiver-support). [Employers](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/ntuc-calls-flexi-work-statutory-paid-leave-workers-who-are-caregivers) are also encouraged to provide flexible work arrangements and paid leave to workers who are caregivers.

## **However, are caregivers being supported equally with respect to the broad range of care recipients?**

<br><br>
Everyone plays a key role in the caregiver support ecosystem, including family caregivers, employers, service providers, and friends/co-workers. 
<br><br>
The key <a href="https://www.ncss.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ncss-publications-doc/pdfdocument/qol-caregiver-report.pdf?sfvrsn=d2655a29_6">social services</a> available to caregivers include financial (e.g. Home Caregiving Grant, Seniors’ Mobility and Enabling Grant); respite care (nursing homes); training (Eldercare Foreign Domestic Worker Scheme); psychological (Caregiver Support Networks); and workplace (flexible work arrangement). 
<br><br>
<a href="https://www.ncss.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ncss-publications-doc/pdfdocument/qol-caregiver-report.pdf?sfvrsn=d2655a29_6">Organisations</a> that cater to specific groups of caregivers include Agency for Integrated Care (for caregivers of seniors, persons with dementia and mental health conditions); SG Enable (for caregivers of persons with disabilities); Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore; Dementia Singapore; Caregiving Welfare Association; Caregivers Alliance Limited; and Caregivers' Association of the Mentally Ill.

		<td><b>Caregivers are still in need of more support..</b>
<br><br>
The <a href="https://www.ncss.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ncss-publications-doc/pdfdocument/qol-caregiver-report.pdf?sfvrsn=d2655a29_6">NCSS Quality of Life of Caregivers study</a> shows that 53% of caregivers were "burdened" or “barely coping” and had lower quality of life and self-efficacy. They faced financial problems, health issues, schedule disruption, and lack of family support caregiver. <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/caregiver-support">Informal caregiving</a> will continue to rise given that by 2030, about <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/big-read-ageing-population-more-seniors-needing-care-assisted-living-3599786">100,000 seniors</a> will require help with at least one daily living activity.
<br><br>
            Gender disparity in caretaking exists. Many <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/caregivers-deserve-better-and-society-must-better-value-what-they-do-president-halimah">women</a> </a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mdm-rahayu-mahzam-senior-parliamentary-secretary-ministry-of-health-at-the-home-nursing-foundation-caregiving-conference-6-oct">sacrifice their careers</a> to take on caregiving. <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/caregiving-grant-burden-elderly-single-unmarried-daughters-1327496">Unmarried daughters</a> are more likely to care for their ageing parents. Long-term care is often provided by family, friends, and neighbours, where most caregivers are women, between 45 and 59 years of age. 
<br><br>
Low-income families need more caregiving support to cope with both work and caring for their children. The <a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/media-room/article/Motion-On-Singapore-Womens-Development.aspx">MSF</a> is partnering with a charity, <a href="https://daughtersoftomorrow.org/">Daughters of Tomorrow</a>, to pilot a childminding service for underprivileged women.

<br><br>
Singapore’s fourth <a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/media-room/article/Enabling-Masterplan-2030---Working-Together-Towards-An-Inclusive-Singapore">Enabling Masterplan 2030</a> (EMP2030) envisages Singapore as an inclusive society in 2030.

<br><br>
Singapore has been empowering seniors to age actively since 2015. The <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/launch-of-the-2023-action-plan-for-successful-ageing">2023 Action Plan for Successful Ageing</a> empowers Singaporeans to be responsible for their own ageing journeys. It focuses on ‘Care’, ‘Contribution’ and ‘Connectedness’ to help seniors live life to the fullest such as supporting persons living with dementia and their caregivers, and incentivising employers to offer flexible work arrangements. 
<br><br>    
</td>
        <td><b>Caregivers lack resources caring for persons with intellectual disabilities (ID).</b> 
<br><br>
Many family caregivers of persons with ID lack the necessary skills and resources. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jppi.12441">Targeted family support</a> such as skill training workshops and intervention supports promoting family empowerment, can improve the well-being of caregivers of people with ID across the lifespan. This will help in the development of an inclusive community living as well as reducing institutionalisation. 
<br><br>
Autism is a lifelong and complex condition. People with autism need a range of support spanning across different sectors such as health, education, and social care. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/reader/10.1177/13623613211016112">More flexible and inclusive support</a>, as well as a change in societal attitudes towards autism, are needed to combat stigma and discrimination.

		<td><b>Some caregivers have had positive caregiving experiences. </b>
<br><br>
Caregivers can have both negative and positive experiences of caregiving. 
<br><br>	
A 2022 <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/62/9/e493/6314281">study</a> has identified positive aspects of caregiving which includes the quality of the relationship between caregiver and receiver, a caregiver’s feeling of accomplishment and the meaning of the caregiver’s role. 
<br><br>
Caregivers with higher <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12877-020-01951-8.pdf">self-efficacy</a> are capable of identifying positive aspects of caregiving. Higher self-efficacy, the ability to overcome difficulties, is linked to better health and coping outcomes for caregivers of persons with dementia in Singapore. 
<br><br>
</td>
		<td><b>For others, caregiving is associated with a lower quality of life.</b>  
<br><br>
According to the <a href="https://www.ncss.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ncss-publications-doc/pdfdocument/qol-caregiver-report.pdf?sfvrsn=d2655a29_6">NCSS Quality of Life of Caregivers study</a>, caregivers who experience a lower quality of life tend to have lower household incomes, are unemployed or part-time employed, seniors aged 65 and above, and live in 4-room HDB flats and below. 
<br><br>
Caregivers also have lower quality of life in social relationships and personal beliefs. In the study, caregivers had lowest scores in recreation and leisure, financial adequacy, sleep and rest, and positive feelings.
