Singapore is considered a [‘blue zone’ city](https://fortune.com/well/2023/08/29/singapore-sixth-blue-zone-longevity-secrets-dan-buettner/) where people live [extraordinarily long lives](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/blue-zone-singapore-beyond-longevity). Singaporeans can expect to live to about [84 years old](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-blue-zone-netflix-healthy-living-longevity-3848606) on average. It’s a city where retirement can be an exciting new chapter. However, living in one of the world’s [most expensive cities](https://www.eiu.com/n/singapore-and-zurich-top-the-list-as-the-worlds-most-expensive-cities/) has its own set of challenges, especially when it comes to planning for retirement. 

 

Retirement allows for the pursuit of endless new possibilities. More time can be [spent with family, serving the community, and pursuing new hobbies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewrosen/2024/02/08/finding-your-purpose-in-retirement). To prepare for the “[super-aged” society](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/initiatives-in-place-to-help-tackle-ageing-as-s-pore-nears-super-aged-status-in-2026-ong-ye-kung)”, Singapore has good retirement support, such as [CPF LIFE](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/retirement-income/monthly-payouts/cpf-life), [Medisave](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/healthcare-financing/using-your-medisave-savings), [CareShield Life](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/healthcare-financing/careshield-life) and [Silver Support Scheme](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/retirement-income/government-support/silver-support-scheme). Various programmes and initiatives, including [Age Well SG](https://www.agewellsg.gov.sg/), ensure ageing Singaporeans remain active and healthy. Additionally, Singapore is building more [senior-friendly homes and neighbourhoods](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/national-day-rally-2023-hdb-flats-elderly-ease-upgrades-senior-citizens-3711426) and [active ageing centres](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-active-ageing-centres-boost-to-retirement-schemes-for-seniors-forward-sg-report). Some Singaporeans even aspire to retire early. Millennials, in particular, are pursuing the [FIRE](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/fire-financial-independence-retire-early-work-jobs-invest-2881331) (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement. 

 

Despite this, retirement may not be a viable option for some. They need to ensure they do not outlive their savings, as expenses may increase with age due to declining health and [inflation](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/how-inflation-changing-face-retirement). Today's high cost of living makes saving for retirement a challenge for many Singaporeans. According to a [2023 survey](https://www.manulife.com.sg/en/about-us/newsroom/singapore-respondents-hope-of-saving-for-retirement-stifled-by-more-immediate-financial-and-lifestyle-pressures.html), only 35% of Singapore respondents have a retirement savings plan, although 63% understand the importance of retirement savings. Driven by these financial concerns, another survey revealed that [87% of Singaporeans](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/invest/retirement-financial-planning-quality-of-life-report-hsbc-singapore) plan to work post-retirement.
