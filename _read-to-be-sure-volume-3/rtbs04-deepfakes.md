## **Are deepfakes all bad, or can they be used for good?**

 

From fans and members of the White House expressing outrage at the [explicit deepfake images of Taylor Swift on X](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/fake-online-images-of-taylor-swift-alarm-white-house), formerly known as Twitter, to [deepfake videos of PM Lee Hsien Loong and DPM Lawrence Wong ](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/deepfake-pm-lee-scam-danger-disinformation-election-4050821)used for [scams](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/deepfake-video-pm-lee-investment-scam-4012946) closer to home, seeing is no longer believing. While [deepfake technology is hardly new](https://www.britannica.com/technology/deepfake), the increasing  [misuse](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N33P28O/) and [disruption](https://time.com/6565446/biden-deepfake-audio/) by bad actors raises concerns [ among lawmakers](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/artificial-intelligence-deepfakes-2024-election-states-rcna129525) and [the public](https://itbrief.co.nz/story/research-finds-millennials-and-boomers-fear-deepfakes-and-biometrics-most-of-future-tech) about the [real-world threat to society](https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/public-urged-to-be-on-guard-as-deepfake-content-will-grow-more-sophisticated-experts).

## What are deepfakes?  

![](https://sure.nlb.gov.sg/images/rtbs-hot-topic-web-banner_deepfake2.png)

[Deepfakes](https://www.wionews.com/entertainment/lifestyle/news-explained-what-are-deepfakes-and-how-to-spot-them-655753) are digitally altered content, typically videos or audio recordings, created by using artificial intelligence (AI) to realistically modify the appearance, speech, or behavior of individuals, often portraying them as saying or doing things they never actually did. The [term](https://www.britannica.com/technology/deepfake) combines *deep* from AI deep-learning technology, and *fake*, which refers to the content that is not real.

The misuse and abuse of this technology is further intensified by the surge of [generative AI](https://oecd.ai/en/incidents/21884) [ and user-friendly apps](https://www.wired.com/story/cheap-easy-deepfakes-closer-real-thing/) that have made it more [accessible to anyone](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them). The fears of [cybersecurity, scams and fraud](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/scammers-use-deepfakes-to-create-voice-recordings-and-videos-of-victims-family-friends-to-trick-them) are valid and deepfake technology has made it [all the more difficult to fight misinformation and disinformation.](https://theconversation.com/fake-biden-robocall-to-new-hampshire-voters-highlights-how-easy-it-is-to-make-deepfakes-and-how-hard-it-is-to-defend-against-ai-generated-disinformation-221744) 

###  So, is there any good use of deepfake technology?

Deepfakes serve as a powerful illustration of how generative AI has the potential for good across different fields such as e-commerce, healthcare, art, education and entertainment. In the world of advertising, it can help [break down linguistic barriers](https://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2022/02/article_0003.html) as in the case David Beckham’s “Malaria No More” campaign where the famous footballer “delivered” the messages in 9 different languages. [Hollywood is already using “de-aging technology”](https://screenrant.com/movies-deepfake-technology-change-hollywood-how/) to bring back performers who have passed on or achieve realistic depictions of their younger selves. There is also the promise of [making education more engaging, interactive and accessible](https://techinformed.com/deepfakes-for-good-how-synthetic-media-is-transforming-business/) through deepfake in the classrooms. Similar AI-generated video technology used in deepfakes for hoaxes and bogus content has also been used as [a form of entertainment](https://youtu.be/jnNQEiPs5r0?si=8LSSb0-5hXqMQQ-z) particularly on social media (see “[deeptomcruise](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/06/tech/tom-cruise-deepfake-tiktok-company/index.html)”).

 

According to a Bloomberg article, the potential of deepfake technology has attracted [serious investments from venture capitalists](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-17/deepfake-detection-tech-becomes-a-focus-for-venture-capital) (VC) with USD$187.7 million invested in 2022, up from USD$1 million in 2017. This trend is expected to continue as more use cases emerge. New York-based startup, Runway (its technology was behind the Oscar-winning film *[Everything Everywhere All at Once](https://time.com/collection/time100-companies-2023/6285166/runway/)*) secured USD[$141 million funding in 2023](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/29/runway-a-startup-building-generative-ai-for-content-creators-raises-141m/) not just from traditional VCs but from tech giants Google, Nvidia and Salesforce. Additionally, deepfake media detection startups have also seen investments in 2023: [Reality Defender](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deepfake-detection-platform-reality-defender-122200225.html) raised USD$15 million while [Deepmedia signed a USD$25 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Deepfake-spotting-startup-eyes-Asian-government-clients).

 

Tackling the problems of deepfake is not easy. In addition to developing [more detection tools](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/01/24/plagiarism-fakes-and-copycats-these-are-the-best-tools-to-spot-ai-generated-content), [lawmakers](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/states-turn-attention-regulating-ai-deepfakes-2024-rcna135122) across the world are [proposing bills](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/ai-deepfakes-bill-pushes-publicity-rights-spurs-speech-concerns) and exploring new [regulations](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/uk-considers-clear-labeling-law-combat-ai-deepfakes/161861/), and social media companies are [updating their policies](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/14/youtube-adapts-its-policies-for-the-coming-surge-of-ai-videos/?guccounter=1). Others have looked to [public education](https://news.mit.edu/2022/fostering-media-literacy-age-deepfakes-0217) and equipping people with [critical thinking skills](https://theconversation.com/deepfakes-how-to-empower-youth-to-fight-the-threat-of-misinformation-and-disinformation-221171) to safeguard the digital world.
