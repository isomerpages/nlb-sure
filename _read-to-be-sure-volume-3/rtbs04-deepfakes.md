## **Are deepfakes all bad, or can they be used for good?**

 

From fans and members of the White House expressing outrage at the [explicit deepfake images of Taylor Swift on X](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/fake-online-images-of-taylor-swift-alarm-white-house), formerly known as Twitter, to [deepfake videos of PM Lee Hsien Loong and DPM Lawrence Wong ](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/deepfake-pm-lee-scam-danger-disinformation-election-4050821)used for [scams](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/deepfake-video-pm-lee-investment-scam-4012946) closer to home, seeing is no longer believing. While [deepfake technology is hardly new](https://www.britannica.com/technology/deepfake), the increasing  [misuse](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N33P28O/) and [disruption](https://time.com/6565446/biden-deepfake-audio/) by bad actors raises concerns [ among lawmakers](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/artificial-intelligence-deepfakes-2024-election-states-rcna129525) and [the public](https://itbrief.co.nz/story/research-finds-millennials-and-boomers-fear-deepfakes-and-biometrics-most-of-future-tech) about the [real-world threat to society](https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/public-urged-to-be-on-guard-as-deepfake-content-will-grow-more-sophisticated-experts). 

 

## What are deepfakes? 

![](https://sure.nlb.gov.sg/images/rtbs-hot-topic-web-banner_deepfake2.png)

[Deepfakes](https://www.wionews.com/entertainment/lifestyle/news-explained-what-are-deepfakes-and-how-to-spot-them-655753) are digitally altered content, typically videos or audio recordings, created by using artificial intelligence (AI) to realistically modify the appearance, speech, or behavior of individuals, often portraying them as saying or doing things they never actually did. The [term](https://www.britannica.com/technology/deepfake) combines *deep* from AI deep-learning technology, and *fake*, which refers to the content that is not real. 

 

The misuse and abuse of this technology is further intensified by the surge of [generative AI](https://oecd.ai/en/incidents/21884) [ and user-friendly apps](https://www.wired.com/story/cheap-easy-deepfakes-closer-real-thing/) that have made it more [accessible to anyone](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them). The fears of [cybersecurity, scams and fraud](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/scammers-use-deepfakes-to-create-voice-recordings-and-videos-of-victims-family-friends-to-trick-them) are valid and deepfake technology has made it [all the more difficult to fight misinformation and disinformation.](https://theconversation.com/fake-biden-robocall-to-new-hampshire-voters-highlights-how-easy-it-is-to-make-deepfakes-and-how-hard-it-is-to-defend-against-ai-generated-disinformation-221744) 

###  So, is there any good use of deepfake technology?

Deepfakes serve as a powerful illustration of how generative AI has the potential for good across different fields such as e-commerce, healthcare, art, education and entertainment. In the world of advertising, it can help [break down linguistic barriers](https://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2022/02/article_0003.html) as in the case David Beckham’s “Malaria No More” campaign where the famous footballer “delivered” the messages in 9 different languages. [Hollywood is already using “de-aging technology”](https://screenrant.com/movies-deepfake-technology-change-hollywood-how/) to bring back performers who have passed on or achieve realistic depictions of their younger selves. There is also the promise of [making education more engaging, interactive and accessible](https://techinformed.com/deepfakes-for-good-how-synthetic-media-is-transforming-business/) through deepfake in the classrooms. Similar AI-generated video technology used in deepfakes for hoaxes and bogus content has also been used as [a form of entertainment](https://youtu.be/jnNQEiPs5r0?si=8LSSb0-5hXqMQQ-z) particularly on social media (see “[deeptomcruise](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/06/tech/tom-cruise-deepfake-tiktok-company/index.html)”).

 

According to a Bloomberg article, the potential of deepfake technology has attracted [serious investments from venture capitalists](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-17/deepfake-detection-tech-becomes-a-focus-for-venture-capital) (VC) with USD$187.7 million invested in 2022, up from USD$1 million in 2017. This trend is expected to continue as more use cases emerge. New York-based startup, Runway (its technology was behind the Oscar-winning film *[Everything Everywhere All at Once](https://time.com/collection/time100-companies-2023/6285166/runway/)*) secured USD[$141 million funding in 2023](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/29/runway-a-startup-building-generative-ai-for-content-creators-raises-141m/) not just from traditional VCs but from tech giants Google, Nvidia and Salesforce. Additionally, deepfake media detection startups have also seen investments in 2023: [Reality Defender](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deepfake-detection-platform-reality-defender-122200225.html) raised USD$15 million while [Deepmedia signed a USD$25 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Deepfake-spotting-startup-eyes-Asian-government-clients).

 

Tackling the problems of deepfake is not easy. In addition to developing [more detection tools](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/01/24/plagiarism-fakes-and-copycats-these-are-the-best-tools-to-spot-ai-generated-content), [lawmakers](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/states-turn-attention-regulating-ai-deepfakes-2024-rcna135122) across the world are [proposing bills](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/ai-deepfakes-bill-pushes-publicity-rights-spurs-speech-concerns) and exploring new [regulations](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/uk-considers-clear-labeling-law-combat-ai-deepfakes/161861/), and social media companies are [updating their policies](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/14/youtube-adapts-its-policies-for-the-coming-surge-of-ai-videos/?guccounter=1). Others have looked to [public education](https://news.mit.edu/2022/fostering-media-literacy-age-deepfakes-0217) and equipping people with [critical thinking skills](https://theconversation.com/deepfakes-how-to-empower-youth-to-fight-the-threat-of-misinformation-and-disinformation-221171) to safeguard the digital world. 

 

So, do you think that deepfake technology can ever make a positive impact?

        <th style="width:50%"><font size=5>Yes, deepfake technology is being used for good.</font></th>
        <th><font size=5>No, deepfake technology is far too riddled with problems. </font></th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Deepfakes can be used for educational purposes.</b>
<br><br>
Deepfake technology can be used for educational purposes. Museums have brought “art and history to life” as in the case of Dali Lives exhibition and Samsung’s AI research lab’s Mona Lisa. There are positive use cases of deepfakes in the classroom such as engaging with historical figures.
<br><br>
</td>
		<td><b>Deepfakes can mislead and misinform, undermining public trust.</b>
<br><br>
There is a growing number of deepfakes of political figures such as US President Biden, Slovakia’s election candidates discussing how to rig votes and Ukraine President Zelenskiy’s call to lay down arms. These are but the tip of the iceberg of the waves of disinformation arising from deepfake technology. Experts and lawmakers caution that deepfakes could harm reputation and disrupt elections globally. 
 </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Deepfake could potentially improve healthcare and accessibility.</b>	 
<br><br>
Generative adversarial networks (GAN), the algorithms behind deepfakes, could assist in the accuracy of cancer and dental diagnosis and therapy. Patients who suffer from voice loss could possibly preserve or reclaim their voices with deepfake audio. There is also the possibility of removing language barriers for entertainment, communication and education purposes. 
</td>
        <td><b>The use of deepfakes is worsening online harms against women. </b> 
<br><br>
While edited images or video are not a new concept, AI technology like deepfake has made the process easier and more accessible. Non-consensual creation of graphic images and videos are putting girls and women at increased risk of online harms, as in the cyberbullying case of young girls in Spain and harassment of celebrities like Taylor Swift. Some believe too that with more women becoming victims of deepfake, “we face a future where women’s voices are traded and their voices muted”.  
<br><br>            
</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Entertainment industry stand to gain from the use of deepfake technology.</b>
<br><br>
There are countless applications of deepfake technology in the entertainment industry – from recreating scenes with unavailable actors or depicting them younger as in the case of the ‘de-aged’ Mark Hamill in The Mandalorian and Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny to exploring new creative expressions. Production companies could save money and time by leveraging on deepfake technology to edit or alter videos without requiring a reshoot. Celebrities or influencers could also create personalised messages or increase their reach and presence globally as seen in footballer Lionel Messi’s partnership with PepsiCo, which enabled fans to generate customised video messages using his deepfake avatar in 8 different languages.  
</td>
		<td><b>For others, caregiving is associated with a lower quality of life.</b>  
<br><br>Scammers can use deepfake technology to create voice recordings to trick victims into transferring money, or produce promotional videos that realistically feature celebrities or politicians endorsing products and services that they never did. In fact, in January 2024, it was reported that YouTube has deleted more than 1,000 deepfake advertisements featuring renowned personalities. Experts are concerned that as such technologies go mainstream without strong guardrails, we will see an increase in the volume and customisation of such cybercrimes.
