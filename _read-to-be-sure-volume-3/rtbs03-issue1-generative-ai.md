Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm, and for good reason. It has gone mainstream and could revolutionise society and the economy as we know it. This technology has caused both [excitement and fear about the future](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/06/21/as-ai-spreads-experts-predict-the-best-and-worst-changes-in-digital-life-by-2035/). [72% of Singaporeans surveyed are excited](https://sg.style.yahoo.com/more-working-singaporeans-excited-generative-171604863.html?guccounter=1) to use GenAI at work, but 51% cited worries about jobs. 

Many people are excited because GenAI can create [new content](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/), including code, essays, images, social media posts, and videos. [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) garnered [100 million users](https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/chatgpt-openai-everyday-guide-17777804.php) in just two months after its launch. The possibilities seem limitless! 

With advancements in the technology, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between [human and machine-generated content](https://www.cutter.com/article/generative-ai-future-content-creation-tech-advisor), [fact and fiction](https://www.fastcompany.com/90873422/ai-feels-like-a-magic-act-by-2033-it-will-be-a-horror-movie). There is a lot of [hype and hysteria](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65162257) around GenAI. Enthusiasts argue that it could [transform](https://www.weforum.org/press/2023/05/breaking-down-barriers-business-academia-and-government-collaborate-on-generative-ai-development/) the world for the better as such tools are overcoming language barriers and automating tasks. There is potential for great impact in education. For example, it could help [teachers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/03/03/generative-ai-education-in-the-age-of-innovation/?sh=70e753d14eca) create interactive learning experiences for students and encourage [critical thinking in students](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/06/chatgpt-learning-tool). 

Pessimists predict [job disruption](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2023/03/31/goldman-sachs-predicts-300-million-jobs-will-be-lost-or-degraded-by-artificial-intelligence/?sh=1f287981782b), [increase wealth inequality](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/08/ai-chatgpt-jobs-economy-inequality), loss of privacy, and diminishing human intelligence. Critics say that GenAI [lacks creativity](https://www.voanews.com/a/artificial-intelligence-can-create-but-lacks-creativity-say-critics/7068177.html) and is [encroaching on creativity](https://itif.org/publications/2023/05/01/tech-panics-generative-ai-and-the-need-for-regulatory-caution/). IMDA’s [AI Verify Foundation](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/) identifies six [risks](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/downloads/Discussion_Paper.pdf), including mistakes and hallucinations, privacy and confidentiality, disinformation and cyber-threats, and embedded bias. 

GenAI is in its infancy and its [implications](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/downloads/Discussion_Paper.pdf) are not fully known. Some experts fear that it could be used for [malicious](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65855333) exploitation. Nevertheless, it has great potential to empower individuals and organisations. When used in a safe and responsible manner, this technology can unlock tremendous opportunities that transform many aspects of modern life.

		<td><b>Generative AI could unleash the next productivity frontier and raise global GDP</b>
<br><br>
GenAI could revolutionise the way many <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#introduction">jobs</a> are performed such as sales and marketing, customer operations, and software development. 
<br><br>
Not only could it boost productivity, but it could also raise global GDP by 7% and increase productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points over a 10-year period, according to <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html">Goldman Sachs Research</a>. 
<br><br>
But perhaps the most exciting thing about this technology is the way it promotes divergent thinking and <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/07/how-generative-ai-can-augment-human-creativity">augments human creativity</a>. By challenging expertise bias and helping us create unimaginable solutions, it opens up a whole new world of innovation.

		<td><b>Generative AI could cause major disruption for the labour market</b>
<br><br>
Advances in AI could expose some <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent.html">300 million jobs</a> worldwide to automation. In the U.S., two thirds of occupations could be partially automated, with a quarter of their workload replaced. However, most jobs and industries are likely to be complemented rather than replaced by AI. 
<br><br>
            While it’s true that GenAI will create many new jobs, it’s likely that many existing jobs will be altered, from entry-level positions to those at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/how-generative-ai-chatgpt-will-change-jobs-at-all-work-levels.html">professional</a> levels, including the C-suite and middle managers.

GenAI tools such as ChatGPT and Midjourney are threatening to disrupt the world of <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/11/how-generative-ai-is-changing-creative-work">content creation</a>, impacting on marketing, software, design, entertainment, and interpersonal communications.<BR><BR>

Most Singaporeans are comfortable using AI for analytical work (<a href="https://www.asiaone.com/business/microsoft-work-trend-index-2023-singapore-data-unveils-opportunities-unlock-workplace">87%</a>), administrative tasks (<a href="https://www.asiaone.com/business/microsoft-work-trend-index-2023-singapore-data-unveils-opportunities-unlock-workplace">85%</a>), and even creative work (<a href="">81%</a>).

With GenAI changing the nature of creativity, there is growing concern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jan/23/its-the-opposite-of-art-why-illustrators-are-furious-about-ai">among artists and critics</a> that it could spell the end of human creativity and originality.
<br><br>
While it might not entirely replace human ingenuity, GenAI has demonstrated the ability to <a href="https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/will-ai-kill-human-creativity">produce “a hit song”</a> in a fraction of the time. 
  <br><br>
            Reliance on earning technologies that can visualise and conceptualise for us may lead to a <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/04/how-generative-ai-could-disrupt-creative-work">decline in primary artistic skills</a>, such as writing, drawing or painting. These skills typically require a deep understanding, continuous practice, and the development of expertise over time. While it democratises the artistic practice and it seems that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-art-created-by-artificial-intelligence/">anyone can be an artist now</a>	, is it impending doom for human creativity? As the emphasis shifts away from honing these skills and towards relying on technology, the risk of losing the ability to create without GenAI tools looms large.             															<br><br>
