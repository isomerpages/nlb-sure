        <h3>Survey Design Issues - The Population</h3>
      	
        <h5>Conslderations concerning the population:</h5>
        <p><strong>Literacy Rate</strong></p>
        <p>The literacy rate in both Japan and Singapore are high. Therefore, the majority of the population in these two countries will have no problem filling up a questionnaire.</p>
                
        <br>
        
        <p><strong>Language</strong></p>
        <p>In Brenda’s case, the Japanese speak one language, so the questionnaires or interviews may be written or conducted in Japanese.</p>
        <p>Brad’s target population is students and working adults so they may conduct their interviews in English.</p>
     
        <br>
        
        <p><strong>Cooperation</strong></p>
        <p>Brenda’s research is about milk. It is not a sensitive topic. Therefore the target population is likely to cooperate with her.</p>
        <p>Brad’s research is about SARs. It is also not a sensitive topic. Therefore their target population should be quite cooperative in the survey.</p>
        
        
        <br>
        
        <p><strong>Geographical Area</strong></p>
        <p>In Brenda’s case, Japan is a big country, so face-to-face interviews are not feasible. Telephone interviews and questionnaires may be more practical.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, Brenda may redefine her population as ‘Japanese living in the 5 biggest Japanese cities’. This will reduce the geographical area to be covered and allow face-to-face interviews to be conducted.</p>
		<p>In Brad’s case, Singapore is a small country and face-to-face interviews may be used.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h5>Summary:</h5>        
        <p><strong>The factors to consider regarding the population are:</strong></p>
        <ul class="simplelisting width60">
        <li>Is the population distributed over a wide area?</li>
        <li>Should the questionnaire be designed in more than one language?</li>
        <li>What is the literacy rate?
        	<ul class="SUB_simplelisting">
        		<li>For countries with low literacy rate, interviews may be more effective than questionnaires (i.e. delivered through mail and email surveys).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Will the population cooperate with the researchers?
        	<ul class="SUB_simplelisting">
        		<li>This is an issue if you are researching personal and sensitive issues (like abortions and cheating) as people may avoid your interviews or not respond to your questionnaires.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
