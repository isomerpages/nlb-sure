        <h3>Survey Design Issues - The Sample</h3>
        <h5>Conslderations concerning the population:</h5>
        <p><strong>Response Rates</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Will your sample respond to your surveys? </strong></p>
        <p>The success of the survey depends on the response rate. In Brenda’s case, conducting a face-to-face interview will guarantee a higher response rate as compared to Brad and his group. People may choose not to respond to Brad’s email survey and treat it as junk mail.</p>
        <p>If the response rate is expected to be low, what can you do? One solution is to send out more questionnaires. For example, if you want a sample of 100 and the response rate is expected to be 50%, then you should send out at least 200 questionnaires.</p>
        <p><strong>Size</strong></p>
        <p><strong>You should decide on the size of your sample. </strong> For your school project, you should choose a sample size based on your resources – i.e. the time, manpower and budget available to gather and process the data. </p>
        <p>Given the size and scope of your project, an average sample size should be 25 to 100. This will provide you with adequate information to make recommendations and conclusions based on your problem statement.</p>
        <p>Face-to-face interviews lend itself better to smaller sample sizes as compared to questionnaires which generally survey a larger number of people. For Brenda, a smaller sample size is more feasible as compared to Brad and his group.</p>
        <p><strong>Location</strong></p>
        <p><strong>You need to know where members of your sample can be found</strong>.  For example, if you are sending questionnaires to your sample, where will you find their names, postal or email addresses? </p>
        <p>For telephone interviews, one possible solution is to use the telephone book and call the first name that appears on every fiftieth page.</p>
        <p>For Brad and his team, getting hold of email addresses might be difficult as not many people list their email addresses in a directory. <br>
          However, market research companies do sell these databases of email addresses. Brenda on the other hand can invite people to participate in her interview by going to public places like shopping malls.</p>
        <p><strong>Representation</strong></p>
        <p><strong>You need to ensure that your sample represents your population.</strong></p>
        <p>For example, if the population consists of 77% Chinese, 14% Malay and 8% Indians, the sample should reflect these proportions as well. If the sex ratio is 50:50, then the number of males and females in the sample should be equal.</p>
        <p>Both Brad and Brenda have to ensure that their sample represents their target population in terms of race, age, gender and other important characteristics.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Summary:</h5>
        <p><strong>The factors to consider regarding the sample are:</strong></p>
        <ul class="simplelisting width60">
          <li>Decide on the size of your sample</li>
          <li>Know where members of your sample can be found</li>
          <li>Ensure that your sample represents your population</li>
          <li>Will your sample respond to your survey?</li>
        </ul>
