        <div class="leftcontent55" style="width:50%;">
          <p>Brad's group has completed the Research Methods section. Here is a summary of the items that are usually included in this section. </p>
          <h5 class="mrgnTB">How were the Questionnaires Returned?</h5>
          <p>This item is required in surveys involving  questionnaires. If you send out survey questionnaires  to people by post or through email, you need to explain how the completed questionnaires were sent back to you  by the respondents.</p>

          <ul class="simplelisting">
            <li>Through collection boxes placed at various locations</li>

            <li>By post, using self-addressed envelopes.</li>
