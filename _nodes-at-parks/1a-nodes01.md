<h2>Are single-use plastics just misunderstood?</h2>

We all know that plastics are non-biodegradable and last for hundreds of years in the ecosystem. Plastic pollution is one of the biggest threats to marine ecosystems, with the prevalence of microplastics in the ocean. Yet, there are still instances where plastics are deemed essential to human activity, playing an important role in our daily lives, as well as in business supply chains. Is plastic use a necessary evil?

<br><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; color:"black"">Single-use or disposable plastics are not biodegradable and break down into micro particles that contaminate our environment, such as our oceans, and may persist for decades to come, affecting the wildlife and disrupting the ecosystem.<br> 
Plastic pollution also disproportionately affects poorer and disadvantaged communities, especially in countries with low recycling rates and difficulties in proper collection of discarded plastics.
