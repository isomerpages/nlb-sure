### About the S.U.R.E. campaign

The S.U.R.E. campaign is an initiative by the [National Library Board](http://www.nlb.gov.sg/) to promote the importance of information searching and discernment. The nation-wide campaign was launched in 2013, and Singapore is the first country outside of the United States to promote Information Literacy (IL) on a national scale for the general public.

S.U.R.E. distills key Information Literacy (IL) concepts into 4 simple ways:
* Source: Look as its origins. Is it trustworthy?
* Understand: Know what you’re reading. Search for clarity.
* Research: Dig deeper. Go beyond the initial source.
* Evaluate: Find the balance. Exercise fair judgement.
